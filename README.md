## Task12) update

Other than the two routes required in this task (Search & trending), I've added two other routes (popular & top rated), you can test those routes be adding ("/popular") or ("/toprated") to your request.

#### Task12) What I have learned so far ?

this task was so interesting for me as this is my very first time dealing wih the backend and sending http requests! üòÅ
it's a little odd for me to be honest, as I am always trying to visualize any application or project I have but still intresting and opens my mind for new ideas and areas to improve.

#### Task12) How long did it take ?

it took around one hour for the task and an extra hour just exploring the new things.

### Task13) update

today was my first time dealing with databases, I was really looking forward to this moment, I imagened it will be more complex but turned out it is not. I found it was easy and really fun to deal with.

### Task14) update

I'm really starting to like dealing with a database and manipulating the entries inside of it, can't wait to mix this knowledge with a frontend framework.

this task took less than one hour.
